# Image-Search

This is the repository for the Python PH talk about Deep Learning for Unstructured Data: Application on Image Search

I was fortunate enough to be able to share my expertise with Deep Learning at one of the [PythonPH's meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pythonph/events/250643274/) in partnership with [Kalibrr](https://www.kalibrr.com).

I talked about how we can leverage Python and its rich scientific and data analysis toolkits to create a working image search engine.
I also emphasized the importance of abstract vector spaces and the general technique of joint training of different models to merge two different vector spaces.
